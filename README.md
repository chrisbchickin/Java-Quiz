# Javascript-Quiz

## Description
The user requested a multiple choice quiz with a timer and score. 
I created a quiz that generates the answer and question elements via Javascript.
I learned how to organize my thought processes better, how to assignt elements to variable and modify them via API's.
I also learned how to manipulate events and local storage.
